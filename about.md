I'm a maker and a builder who believes you must never stop learning, always get your hands dirty,
and lead from the front.  

I'm a product and technology executive who's spent the last 15 years building great
teams and amazing products at large scale at both startups and Fortune 100 companies.

Along the way I've helped author/invent 8 patents, taken two companies global, and been a
CTO (Chief Technology Officer), CPO (Chief Product Officer), and CEO (Chief Executive Officer).
