I'm a maker and a builder who believes you must never stop learning, always get your hands dirty and lead from the front.  

I'm a global product and technology executive with over 17+ years of experience building great
teams and amazing products at web scale for both startups and Fortune 500 companies.

Along the way, I've helped author/invent eight patented technologies, taken three companies globally, and been a
CTO (Chief Technology Officer), CPO (Chief Product Officer), and CEO (Chief Executive Officer).
