Hi, I’m <a href="www.anthonybroadcrawford.com">Anthony Broad-Crawford</a>.  I have no idea what I am supposed to say here, and I stink at writing my biography no matter how short, so you get this :) ...
</p>

<p>
  I’m a 17 year technology executive who has launched several award winning and patent receiving products at "web-scale" (80 million+ monthly users) for both Startups and Fortune 500 companies.  These product have been featured prominently within AppStore(s), on stage at WWDC and Google.io, and debuted on stage at CES by <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, and more.
</p>

<p>
  I’m currently the CEO @ <a href="">abc & company</a>.
