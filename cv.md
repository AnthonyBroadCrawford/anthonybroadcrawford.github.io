I’m a maker and a builder who has embraced continuous learning since childhood.  My passion for learning, exploring and making, while contrasting emerging technologies and methodologies against old, has served me well in a rapidly evolving technology market. A technology market that is experiencing an unprecedented amount of growth and diversification, with no end in sight.

More importantly, I've been very successful in creating organizational cultures and environments that embrace my same passion for learning.  These cultures result in more competitive technology portfolio, improved speed to market, and overall better product performance.  

In addition, a culture of learning provides a haven from the drastically constrained and competitive talent landscape.  Building the infrastructure to support learning at scale not only attracts premier senior talent, but also attracts top emerging talent to become top contributors who then rapidly grow into senior leaders within the company.  

My passion for learning provides me a unique advantage towards building great teams, that build amazing products.

Below you will find a detailed history of my work over the last fifteen years.  You can additionally find more on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonybroadcrawford).
