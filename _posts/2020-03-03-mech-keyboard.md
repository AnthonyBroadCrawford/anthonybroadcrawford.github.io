I finally broke down and purchased a mechanical keyboard.  

Over the last several years, mechanical keyboards have gained in popularity among the technical crowds.  For me, I thought they looked cool and reminded me of my biological father's keyboards on his Commodores and other computers at that time.

I've always wished I could have been a software developer in the eighties.      There is just something so romantic about that era for me as it is where I first became fascinated with computers.  Ultimately I pursued music as my first career, but it is not a surprise I ended up in software.  This purchase is more emotional than anything practical.

I've just started using it, so as of now I don't have much of an opinion.  However, the action and spacing on this keyboard fit my hands perfectly.  

Here it is :)
