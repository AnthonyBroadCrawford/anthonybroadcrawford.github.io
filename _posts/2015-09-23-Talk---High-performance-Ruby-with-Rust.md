I've been exploring [Rust][Rust] over the last year and a half with one big question on my mind, how do I integrate [Rust][Rust] into an existing codebase.  

Taking a high performance language like [Rust][Rust] and pairing it with [Rails](http://www.rails.org), a technology built for rapid feature development, would give a technology team the best of both worlds.

This talk introduces the fundamental components to leveraging [Rust][Rust] from within a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) technology like [Rails](http://www.rails.org) and how to build for high performance.

I'll be given this talk on 11/3/15 @ Groupon's [Geekfest](http://www.meetup.com/Geekfest/).  You can RSVP [here](http://www.meetup.com/Geekfest/events/225236009/).
