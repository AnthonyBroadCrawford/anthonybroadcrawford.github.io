Over the last few months I’ve begun to explore the crypto-currency space.  

I initially began by reading the [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1534355592&sr=8-3&keywords=mastering+bitcoin) book and spinning up a few Bitcoin nodes.  This was incredibly fascinating and exciting given how new some of the larger concepts around decentralization are (at least to me).

Then I began contributing to the open-source projects in [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org)  via the [Ethereum C++ client](http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/) and [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/)  the smart contract programming language.

I am now actively taking development contracts to build Smart Contracts on [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) in a production environment.  I’ve only just begun, so I don’t have that many under my belt at the moment.

I’ve done this simply to learn.  I have no opinion on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solidity or any of these technologies at the moment.  Nor do I have an opinion on these technologies replacing fiat currencies at the moment.  I hope through this to learn more resulting in having an informed opinion, but not there yet.

Here is what I’ve learned so far

- The communities are incredibly welcoming (at least what I have experienced so far)
- The projects are setup to allow someone new to quickly get involved (I love those beginner labels on GitHub issues)
- Core contributors have no problem taking time to answer questions, offer advice and direction
- Communication is a bit fragmented between Gitter, Github, Telegram, and Slack

I’ll keep posting more as I get deeper into the space, but you can follow me on [Github](https://github.com/AnthonyBroadCrawford)  to track any progress and involvement.
