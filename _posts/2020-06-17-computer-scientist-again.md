title: "I'm a Computer Scientist again"

I've spent the better part of the last year and a half working on my new SaaS company, [YachtClub](https://www.yachtclub.ai).  What's exciting about that is the tremendous amount of coding I've had to do.  

As a computer scientist, I spent the first half of my career as a full-time software engineer for both big companies and startups.  In the last half of my career, I've been on the business side as either a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or Chief Product Officer (CPO).  Unfortunately, those roles leave little time for serious software development.  

Enter YachtClub, and the picture has materially changed.  I've haven't gone a single day without spending a few hours authoring software of the last year and a half.  I HAVE MISSED THIS.  

I am not convinced I'll suddenly want a full-time job as a software engineer.   I love my CTO consulting business, abc & company, and I'm still just as excited about building businesses, people, processes, and culture.  For now, I love having a foot firmly in both worlds.
