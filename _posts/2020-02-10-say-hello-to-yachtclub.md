I’m excited as well as a bit anxious to announce that I’m starting a new company, [YachtClub](https://www.yachtclub.ai).  

After spending about a year in the marina, harbor, yacht club industry as a customer, then a volunteer employee, and now [an operator at a prominent local yacht club](https://anthonybroadcrawford.com/2020/02/03/joining-wilmette-yacht-club-board.html), I see a crystal clear opportunity for a new SaaS product to come to market. 

I only formed the company once I was successfully able to get three customers to sign a contract for the software (and one customer actually recruited another customer). So I couldn't ask for a better start. Additionally, this allows me a solid base to verify some of my initial hypotheses.  

Exclusively running venture-backed businesses to date, this is a defiantly a departure. Therefore I’m still gonna keep running my small executive consulting (CTO & CPO on retainer) business abc & company. I hope to earn the right to make [YachtClub](https://www.yachtclub.ai) a fulltime gig.  

As in all things, time will tell :)
