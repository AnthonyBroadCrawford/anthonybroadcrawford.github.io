About seven years ago, when my family and I first moved to North Chicago, we put our names on the waiting list at the local yacht club.  Living as close to the water as we did, it was a no-brainer.  The only downside was the estimated ~15-year waitlist.

Once we put our names on the list, we didn't think about it all that often until we got an acceptance letter last March.  This was much sooner than we would have expected and an incredible surprise.  So I went out and bought a boat to join the yacht club.  A beautiful and gently used 2012 Regal 1900.  

It is one of the best investments we've made as a family.  Everyone loves the boat and the club.  Phoenix loves tubing, Ivy likes swimming off the back deck, Lindsay enjoys anchoring, and I love cruising up and down the Chicago coastline.  There wasn't a single week from April 2019 - October 2019, where the family wasn't out on the water or at the club. 

I enjoyed boating and the club so much that I started becoming involved in and around the harbor.  From the member experience to thoughtful suggestions about technology, and other stuff.  That led to an invitation to explore joining the board, and after the interview process, I was asked to join the board officially :) 

My role is on the board; however, I'll additionally be active with the operator team managing and running the harbor. I'm INCREDIBLY excited to be engaged in the aquatic / marina space.  

So excited.
