It's been a few months since I purchased the [Arduino][Arduino] [Parallax robot kit][Parallax robot kit].  It's a mix of hardware and software with a "following the bouncing ball"tutorial on
how to bring it all together.

I've always loved robots and electronics as a kid.  Loved it even more in college
when I had to take two years worth of electrical engineering.  However, I never
got the opportunity to get my hands dirty physically building something electronic.  The [Arduino][Arduino] [Parallax robot kit][Parallax robot kit] has been love at first site.
